# Spec for proposed traveling salesman algorith

# Step 1:

# loop through every point and calculate the distance & heading to all the surrounding points
# use elimination tables to prevent duplicate searches

# Step 2:

# then, start with a chosen starting point, and average the headings of the remaining points, then travel to the point with the least difference in heading, repeat for each point until they've all been visited
# if one merely wishes to traverse all the points and return to the starting point, simply set the destination point B as the farthest point from the starting one


# efficiency of this algorithm: O(nPn)


# INPUT:

points_input = [[3,10],[8,1],[3,5],[1,4],[8,10],[4,5]]
